#Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. 
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. 
#
# Determine if you are able to reach the last index. 
#
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
#Output: true
#Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# 
#
# Example 2: 
#
# 
#Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
#Output: false
#Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
#Â             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
