#At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. 
#
# Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). 
#
# Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5. 
#
# Note that you don't have any change in hand at first. 
#
# Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change. 
#
# 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
#Output: true
#Explanation: 
#From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
#From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
#From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
#Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
# 
#
# 
# Example 2: 
#
# 
#Input: [5,5,10]
#Output: true
# 
#
# 
# Example 3: 
#
# 
#Input: [10,10]
#Output: false
# 
#
# 
# Example 4: 
#
# 
#Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
#Output: false
#Explanation: 
#From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
#For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
#For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
#Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
# 
#
# 
#
# Note: 
#
# 
# 0 <= bills.length <= 10000 
# bills[i] will be either 5, 10, or 20.
